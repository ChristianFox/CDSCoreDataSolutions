 * Clears the current context. Just sets the context property to nil and created a new one.
 * @warning Really this is intended for unit testing rather than production code, if you hold a reference to the context in another object and call this method that reference will remain & but the context it holds will no longer be part of the stack - this will cause problems if you then try and use the disconnected reference
 * @param handlerOrNil Provides a BOOL for success status and an NSError object which may be nil
